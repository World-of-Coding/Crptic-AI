# Welcome to Crptic AI!

Crptic AI is an open-source auto-coding assistant that generates code based on previous lines. With Crptic AI, users can easily create code for a variety of programming languages without having to manually write every line.

Crptic AI is built on a dataset that is open to anyone to access and download for free. By contributing to the dataset, you can help improve the accuracy and functionality of Crptic AI. The dataset is continuously updated with new inputs and improvements, and your contributions are vital to its success.

Crptic AI is the future of AI-generated code. With its advanced algorithms and ability to understand and interpret user inputs, it can save developers time and effort while also increasing efficiency and reducing the risk of errors.

If you're interested in contributing to Crptic AI, there are several ways to get involved. You can help improve the dataset by providing new inputs and feedback on the generated code. You can also contribute to the development of the software by reporting bugs and suggesting new features.

# Current Version
- v0.1.0 Beta Developing Version
  
DISCAIMER: Crptic is currently now given to WoC but ownership still remains the same.

### How to contribute
- **Improve the dataset:** Help improve the accuracy and functionality of Crptic AI by providing new inputs and feedback on the generated code.
- **Report bugs:** If you find any bugs in the software, please report them to help improve the stability of Crptic AI.
- **Suggest new features:** If you have any suggestions for new features, please let us know. Your ideas can help shape the future of Crptic AI.

# How Crptic AI was made

Crptic AI was developed using the Python programming language and an NLP (Natural Language Processing) algorithm. The NLP algorithm is used to understand and interpret user inputs, which are then used to generate code.

The algorithm is trained on a constantly updating dataset. The dataset is open-source and available for anyone to access and download for free. It contains a wide variety of inputs and code examples that are used to train the algorithm.

The dataset is crucial to the accuracy and functionality of Crptic AI. By contributing to the dataset, you can help improve the performance of the algorithm and make Crptic AI more useful for developers.

The development of Crptic AI was a collaborative effort, and it involved contributions from a team of developers and researchers with expertise in NLP, Python programming, and machine learning.

Crptic AI is an ongoing project and we are constantly working on improving its performance and adding new features. If you're interested in contributing to the development of Crptic AI, please let us know. We welcome contributions from developers and researchers of all skill levels.

# The Plan for Crptic AI

Crptic AI is designed to be the next step in the evolution of auto-generated code, making coding easier and more efficient for developers. Our goal is to create a tool that can understand and interpret user inputs and generate high-quality code that is ready to use.

We are constantly working on improving the performance of the algorithm and adding new features to Crptic AI. Our plan is to continue to train the algorithm on a constantly updating dataset, which will help to improve its accuracy and functionality.

We are also working on expanding the number of programming languages that Crptic AI supports, so that it can be used by a wider range of developers.

Our ultimate goal is for Crptic AI to become a widely used tool that can help developers of all skill levels to create high-quality code more quickly and easily. We believe that Crptic AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we write and use code, and we are excited about the future of this project.
